		<h1>Meridian Main Website</h1>

		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			This project is one of the biggest that I’ve worked on. It was for a Credit Union, and we wanted to make them different from the "Big 5" Canadian banks. We pitched 3 different layouts which you will see below.
				</p>
				<p>
			The welcome section has a cinematography as the background. Users can access their accounts directly from this section, and if they want to access the menu, they can access it from the menu button at the top.
				</p>
				<p>
			When the user starts scrolling, the navigation sticks to the top of the page, so it’s always there to help.
				</p>
				<p>
			Meridian is a company that values their community and customers, so instead of filling the sections with a lot of information about their products or services, we went with placing community news on the homepage.

		<div class="smallitem"><img src="img/merid2/category-page.jpg"></div>
		<!-- <div class="smallitem"><p>
			Top navigation is the scroll version of the home page. This is the products landing page, and at the top we place the easy access anchors to main sections of the accounts. 
		</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			Product page starts with the description, and follows with the necessary information. Each section of this page uses contrast color. So, user knows that they are reading new information.
		</p></div> -->
		<div class="smallitem"><img src="img/merid2/product-page.jpg"></div>
		</div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			This is another concept that plays it safe. It is clean and gives a little more information about the services Meridian provides.
		</p></div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><img src="img/merid1/category-page.jpg"></div>
		<!-- <div class="smallitem"><p>
			Using drop shadow allowed us to keep it clean and orginize while keeping the whole concept really clean.
		</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			Navigation of this concept is actually fully blown from the start. This way user can go the page they need directly with out opening the full menu like other concept. Disadvantage of this is user has to search every tap one by one to find the concent they are looking for.
		</p></div> -->
		<div class="smallitem"><img src="img/merid1/product-page.jpg"></div>
		</div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			The third concept uses the fixed, full height, left navigation style that remains open. This style is a combination of the previous two. Because navigation is on the left, we have the full content area available for actual content.
		</p></div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><img src="img/merid3/category-page.jpg"></div>
		<!-- <div class="smallitem"><p>
			Product landing page directly displayes the categories like the other ones. However, this concept uses 1px lines to divide each product as well as sections. It is clean but still noticable. 
		</p></div>
		</div>

		<div class="flexcontainer">
		<div class="smallitem"><p>
			After clean and simple Products landing page, we wanted to add little illustrations as well as brand colors as a background to give it more life. This concept uses module style. Client can take our, add, or decide the size of the each boxes.
