			This is one the first big projects that I worked on, and it was a great learning experience for me. We took an outdated design and created a new e-commerce base while also improving aesthetics.
			</p>
			<p>
			Because of brand colours we had to work within a strict limit. As well, in Canada, AODA is one of the guidelines that we really need to take it into consideration. We kept the site clean, but at the same time we managed to put a lot of information into the home page.
			</p>
			<p>
